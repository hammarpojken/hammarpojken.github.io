Hello everyone! My name is Niclas and I am 25 years old. I am born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden, where I still live today.
At the moment I live in Johanneberg which is located in a central area in Gothenburg where I live together with my partner Cattis.

I've recently started to study at LNU to see if I can make something  of myself after a few years of traveling around the world, working and enjoying my youth.
