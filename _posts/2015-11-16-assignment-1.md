##What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
Robots.txt is a file where you give instructions about the site to web-robots, such as search engines like google.
In the robots.txt file you declare what content you want the web-robots to index or have access to. I have configured my file so that no
content should be available for the robots, but this does not guarantee that robots still goes through your site.

##What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
Humans.txt is a file where you list the people who developed the website and other people who contributed.
You can also add the tools you've used during the development and so on.
In my Humans.txt i have information about myelf and a few tools that i've used to develop this site.

##How did you implements comments to blog posts?
I used the recommended service Disqus which is free of charge. I had to create an account on their website and then
 they generated unicode which i used in my layout for the posts on my site. I can use comments anywhere i want on the site
 by using the code i got and add a front-matter "comments: true". But for now I'm satisfied with people only commenting on my blog posts.

##What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
The open graph is a way to turn a web page into a graph object by simply adding a few meta-tags to your html code.
By doing this you can choose how your page will be represented when linked into social media for example.
I've choose to only add the four standard meta-tags title, type, url and image.
